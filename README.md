# AERIAL-NETWORK-DELAY
 This project intends to address the issue of routing optimization for  aeronautical networks, where hundreds of aircraft must use ground  stations to access the Internet while flying daily across the North  Atlantic. • The project will employ Python to construct and contrast various  optimisation methods for determining the best flight paths
